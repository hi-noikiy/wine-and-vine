Nowadays the global market requires fast commercial transactions, forcing most business to implement technological 
breakthroughs to manage, for instance, stocks and shipping.

The wine market in Portugal is no different.

That's where WTMS comes to the rescue and try to mitigate this gap.

On this topic, we intend to conceive and implement a system that makes the wine commerce easier and faster in Portugal,
reducing the need of middle man intervention.

The application will have two kinds of users:
- Sellers, which are known as producers;
- Buyers, which are known as consumers;

To accomplish this goal, WTMS is designed in a web based application fashion.

This design style makes WTMS dead easy for sellers to manage their stock's and publish their wine inventory easily. 

The same applies to the consumers, because they can easily filter wines, add them to cart, pay for them and :boom:,
their done!
